[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack)
[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Using a boilerplate to build a full stack web application using React, Node.js, Express and Webpack. It is also configured with webpack-dev-server, eslint, prettier and babel.


### Development mode

In the development mode, we will have 2 servers running. The front end code will be served by the [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) which helps with hot and live reloading. The server side Express code will be served by a node server using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which helps in automatically restarting the server whenever server side code changes.

### Production mode

In the production mode, we will have only 1 server running. All the client side code will be bundled into static files using webpack and it will be served by the Node.js/Express application.

## Quick Start

# Go inside the directory
cd <folder>

# Install dependencies
yarn (or npm install)

# Start development server
yarn dev (or npm run dev)

# Build for production

```
